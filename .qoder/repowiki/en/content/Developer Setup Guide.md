## Prerequisites

Before setting up the development environment for the kvs_website project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js 18+**: The project requires Node.js version 18 or higher. You can verify your Node.js version by running `node --version` in your terminal. If you need to install or upgrade Node.js, download it from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Angular CLI 20.3.3**: Install the Angular CLI globally using npm by running the command `npm install -g @angular/cli@20.3.3`. This specific version is required to maintain compatibility with the project's configuration.

## Repository Setup

To begin working with the kvs_website project, follow these steps to set up your local development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine with the command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the kvs_website repository.

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**: Change into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd kvs_website
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Restore all project dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the required packages listed under dependencies and devDependencies. The installation process may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection speed.

## Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to begin working on the project.

1. **Start the Development Server**: Run the following command to start the local development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   Alternatively, you can use the npm script defined in the `package.json` file:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the Application**: After the server starts successfully, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files, providing a seamless development experience.

The development server configuration is defined in the `angular.json` file, which specifies the port and other settings for the server.

## Angular CLI Commands

The Angular CLI provides powerful tools for generating and managing project artifacts. Use the following commands to scaffold new components, services, and other elements following the project conventions:

- **Generate a New Component**: To create a new component, run:
  ```bash
  ng generate component component-name
  ```
  Replace `component-name` with the desired name for your component. This command creates a new folder with the component files, including TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and test files.

- **Generate a Service**: To create a new service, use:
  ```bash
  ng generate service service-name
  ```
  This generates a service class that can be injected into components for handling business logic or API interactions.

- **Other Schematics**: The Angular CLI supports various schematics such as directives, pipes, guards, and modules. For a complete list of available schematics, run:
  ```bash
  ng generate --help
  ```

The project's schematic configuration in `angular.json` specifies that components should use SCSS for styling.

## Testing and Building

The kvs_website project includes tools for testing and building the application for production deployment.

1. **Run Unit Tests**: To execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the command:
   ```bash
   ng test
   ```
   This starts the Karma test runner and runs all the unit tests in the project. The test configuration is defined in the `karma.conf.js` file, which is generated by the Angular CLI.

2. **Build Production Artifacts**: To compile the project and generate production-ready files, run:
   ```bash
   ng build
   ```
   This command compiles the application and stores the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes the application for performance and speed, including minification and bundling.

The build configuration in `angular.json` includes settings for optimization, source maps, and output paths.

## Troubleshooting

During the setup and development process, you may encounter common issues. Here are solutions to some frequent problems:

- **Version Mismatches**: Ensure that you are using Node.js 18+ and Angular CLI 20.3.3. Version mismatches can cause unexpected errors. Verify your versions with `node --version` and `ng version`.

- **Missing Dependencies**: If you encounter errors related to missing packages, run `npm install` again to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed. Check the `package.json` file to confirm that all required packages are listed.

- **Port Conflicts**: If port 4200 is already in use, the development server will fail to start. You can either stop the process using the port or start the server on a different port with:
  ```bash
  ng serve --port 4201
  ```

- **Development Server Startup Problems**: If the development server fails to start, check for syntax errors in your code or configuration files. Ensure that the `angular.json` and `package.json` files are correctly formatted.

- **Browser Compatibility Issues**: The application is designed to work with modern browsers. If you experience issues, try using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. Avoid using outdated browsers that may not support the latest web standards.
